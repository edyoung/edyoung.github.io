      <title>Replacing T4 Templates with plain C# 11</title>

      <description>Replacing T4 Templates with plain C# 11 Generating files with T4 In Arc-Enabled Servers we have a quite a lot of different config files which need to be mostly the same, but a little different for each region we deploy into. For example, we have values that are used by Helm charts for each region:
Australia East configmap: Environment: Prod Location: &amp;quot;australiaeast&amp;quot; CloudEnvironment: &amp;quot;Public&amp;quot; UseKeyVault: true ... Brazil South configmap: Environment: Prod Location: &amp;quot;brazilsouth&amp;quot; CloudEnvironment: &amp;quot;Public&amp;quot; UseKeyVault: true .</description>

      <title>Deferred Maintenance is a better metaphor than Technical Debt</title>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of discussion about Technical Debt in Software Engineering. I believe the term originated on the C2 wiki. It&amp;rsquo;s often used to explain to non-software-engineers why it&amp;rsquo;s important to invest in code quality.
I&amp;rsquo;m far from the first person to think that the term Technical Debt is potentially misleading. Rob Jeffries has a discussion here.
To oversimplify, debt involves interest payments. These compound over time, occur at predictable intervals, can be paid off, and cost a fairly predictable amount of money.</description>

      <title>Financial Perpetual Motion</title>

      <description>Financial Perpetual Motion Every so often, someone claims to have created a perpetual motion machine, or a source of free energy - some kind of contraption which does work without any external power source. Anyone with any physics background knows that this is impossible, due to the laws of thermodynamics, but these claims still find a small credulous audience. Normally the device is accompanied by lots of handwaving to obscure the fact that it can&amp;rsquo;t possibly work.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: I&amp;rsquo;m not an expert on the crypto space, just a curious amateur. It&amp;rsquo;s quite possible I have misunderstood something important below. Do let me know of any corrections via the comment section!
If you read the Ethereum website on DAO&amp;rsquo;s, you&amp;rsquo;ll see this:
 DAOs are an effective and safe way to work with like-minded folks around the globe.
  Think of them like an internet-native business that&amp;rsquo;s collectively owned and managed by its members.</description>

      <title>Interesting issues encountered with the Azure Connected Machine Agent</title>

      <description>One of the components I work on is the Azure Connected Machine Agent. This is an agent component which can be installed on many different Windows versions and Linux distributions. One thing with a software package which customers install on their own machines is operating systems can be configured in so many different ways. You start to find quite obscure issues that crop up on a tiny fraction of the install base.</description>

      <title>Some environment vars in Cloud Shell</title>

      <description>Cloud Shell sets several environment variables which can be useful. Here&amp;rsquo;s a brain dump on some of the more useful ones- the list is not exhaustive. You can see them by running env. Please note this is not official documentation and these could change!
   Name Example Value Purpose     ACC_CLOUD PROD If you need to check if a script is in Cloud Shell, look for the existence of this variable.</description>

      <title>How Azure Cloud Shell stores your files</title>

      <description>The official information on Cloud Shell&amp;rsquo;s file storage is here. It&amp;rsquo;s good stuff, and covers most things you might like to know, take a look! This blog contains a few more behind-the-scenes details for the curious. NB: We might change this in the future, this isn&amp;rsquo;t guaranteed.
We can see from the docs that all your files are stored in an Azure File Share which belongs to you, and which you select when you first start CLoud Shell.</description>

      <title>Azure Cloud Shell, az login, and Managed Identity</title>

      <description>When you open Azure Cloud Shell and run Get-AzVM or az vm list for the first time, it works right away. But why?
That may seem like an odd question. Of course it should work right away! But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work quite the same way when you run PowerShell or Azure CLI locally - you need to run Connect-AzAccount or az login first. So what&amp;rsquo;s the difference?
A surprising amount of things are happening behind the scenes for this to work, and at the time of writing there are some limitations you might hit.</description>

      <title>Azure Arc command-line tools cheat sheet</title>

      <description>Arc for Servers has a new Azure CLI extension and PowerShell module. Both are still experimental, so expect a few rough edges and please report any issues you see. Because they are prerelease, they are not included (yet) in the main releases (ie, you don&amp;rsquo;t get this just by installing az cli or the Az module). However they are already functional and useful. Here&amp;rsquo;s how to do some simple operations with each of them.</description>

      <title>How to install your own versions of tools in Azure Cloud Shell</title>

      <description>Cloud Shell comes with a lot of tools, and we try to keep them up to date. But sometimes you need something a little bit more cutting edge or unusual. How do you install it?
Using Cloud Shell is a little different from running your own Linux computer, but it&amp;rsquo;s a lot like using a multi-user Unix system. The main difference is you are not root and we won&amp;rsquo;t tell you the root password (sorry).</description>

      <title>Does Azure Cloud Shell store my command history?</title>
      <link>/blog/cloud_shell_history/</link>

      <guid>/blog/cloud_shell_history/</guid>
      <description>A few people have asked &amp;ldquo;Hey, uh, hypothetically, if I had typed a password or a secret at the Cloud Shell prompt, did you store it, and how would I delete it? Obviously I would never do this, asking for a friend.&amp;quot;
Relax, we&amp;rsquo;ve all done it. And the answer is &amp;ldquo;Sort of&amp;rdquo;.
In more detail, Cloud Shell does not store your history itself. But the shell you are running inside it does, unless you have configured something specially.</description>

      <title>What&#39;s the difference between az account show and Get-AzContext?</title>

      <description>One issue which can trip you up when using command-line tools to configure Azure is a confusing lack of interaction between Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell. They both provide a &amp;ldquo;context&amp;rdquo; so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to keep specifying the subscription over and over. But Azure CLI (the az command) has a separate context from Azure PowerShell. You can see this by running
az account show # show azure CLI context Get-AzContext # show azure Powershell context az account set --subscription &#39;mysub2&#39; # change Azure CLI context az account show # azure CLI has changed Get-AzContext # Azure PowerShell has not!</description>
