      <description>Arc for Servers has a new Azure CLI extension and PowerShell module. Both are still experimental, so expect a few rough edges and please report any issues you see. Because they are prerelease, they are not included (yet) in the main releases (ie, you don&amp;rsquo;t get this just by installing az cli or the Az module). However they are already functional and useful. Here&amp;rsquo;s how to do some simple operations with each of them.</description>

      <description>One issue which can trip you up when using command-line tools to configure Azure is a confusing lack of interaction between Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell. They both provide a &amp;ldquo;context&amp;rdquo; so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to keep specifying the subscription over and over. But Azure CLI (the az command) has a separate context from Azure PowerShell. You can see this by running
az account show # show azure CLI context Get-AzContext # show azure Powershell context az account set --subscription &#39;mysub2&#39; # change Azure CLI context az account show # azure CLI has changed Get-AzContext # Azure PowerShell has not!</description>
