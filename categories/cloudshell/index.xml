      <description>When you open Azure Cloud Shell and run Get-AzVM or az vm list for the first time, it works right away. But why?
That may seem like an odd question. But it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work quite the same way when you run PowerShell or Azure CLI locally - you need to run Connect-AzAccount or az login first. So what&amp;rsquo;s the difference?
A surprising amount of things are happening behind the scenes for this to work, and at the time of writing there are some limitations you might hit.</description>

      <title>How to install your own versions of tools in Azure Cloud Shell</title>

      <description>Cloud Shell comes with a lot of tools, and we try to keep them up to date. But sometimes you need something a little bit more cutting edge or unusual. How do you install it?
Using Cloud Shell is a little different from running your own Linux computer, but it&amp;rsquo;s a lot like using a multi-user Unix system. The main difference is you are not root and we won&amp;rsquo;t tell you the root password (sorry).</description>

      <title>Does Azure Cloud Shell store my command history?</title>

      <description>A few people have asked &amp;ldquo;Hey, uh, hypothetically, if I had typed a password or a secret at the Cloud Shell prompt, did you store it, and how would I delete it? Obviously I would never do this, asking for a friend.&amp;quot;
Relax, we&amp;rsquo;ve all done it. And the answer is &amp;ldquo;Sort of&amp;rdquo;.
In more detail, Cloud Shell does not store your history itself. But the shell you are running inside it does, unless you have configured something specially.</description>
