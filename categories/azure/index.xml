      <description>A few people have asked &amp;ldquo;Hey, uh, hypothetically, if I had typed a password or a secret at the Cloud Shell prompt, did you store it, and how would I delete it? Obviously I would never do this, asking for a friend.&amp;quot;
Relax, we&amp;rsquo;ve all done it. And the answer is &amp;ldquo;Sort of&amp;rdquo;.
In more detail, Cloud Shell itself does not store your history itself. But the shell you are running inside it does, unless you have configured something specially.</description>

      <description>One issue which can trip you up when using command-line tools to configure Azure is a confusing lack of interaction between Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell. They both provide a &amp;ldquo;context&amp;rdquo; so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to keep specifying the subscription over and over. But Azure CLI (the az command) has a separate context from Azure PowerShell. You can see this by running
az account show # show azure CLI context Get-AzContext # show azure Powershell context az account set --subscription &#39;mysub2&#39; # change Azure CLI context az account show # azure CLI has changed Get-AzContext # Azure PowerShell has not!</description>
