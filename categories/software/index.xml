      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of discussion about Technical Debt in Software Engineering. I believe the term originated on the C2 wiki. It&amp;rsquo;s often used to explain to non-software-engineers why it&amp;rsquo;s important to invest in code quality.
I&amp;rsquo;m far from the first person to think that the term Technical Debt is potentially misleading. Rob Jeffries has a discussion here.
To oversimplify, debt involves interest payments. These compound over time, occur at predictable intervals, can be paid off, and cost a fairly predictable amount of money.</description>
