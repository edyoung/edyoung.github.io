      <description>A few people have asked &amp;ldquo;Hey, uh, hypothetically, if I had typed a password or a secret at the Cloud Shell prompt, did you store it, and how would I delete it? Obviously I would never do this, asking for a friend.&amp;quot;
Relax, we&amp;rsquo;ve all done it. And the answer is &amp;ldquo;Sort of&amp;rdquo;.
In more detail, Cloud Shell itself does not store your history itself. But the shell you are running inside it does, unless you have configured something specially.</description>
